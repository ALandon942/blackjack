Classes:
 Card
 - values etc
 - ace?
   - can start at 11 and be switched to 1 if hand at risk of bust
 Deck (or shoe)
 - generating all cards
 - shuffling etc
 - dealing
 - returning cards and reshuffling
 Hand
 - rules about bust, victory, etc.
 - switching the value of ace
 - compare to other hand
 Bankroll (for individual player)
 - add
 - subtract
 - hit zero
 Kitty (all players' bets on one round)
 - Rules state every player who beats the dealer wins what they bet EXCEPT those with blackjack get 1.5x what they bet (in addition to recovering their bet)
 - The idea of a kitty maybe doesn't apply to this game since 1) dealer's winnings are effectively ignored 2) dealer's payout is not known til end of round
 - Individual bets are more of a useful class instead
 Bet (one player's bet)
 - initialize with value
   - validate against bankroll
 - apply(hand, bankroll)
   - subtract for loss
   - add for win
 The below may not be necessary because the game's logic will include all this behavior and dealer/player really don't have a lot in common - maybe they can just be functions
 However a player object without much behavior may still be useful to hold all the game objects relevant to that player
 AbstractPlayer for behavior in common between player & dealer: hitting/staying, betting, etc.
 - Player
   - prompting for next move
   - finite bankroll
 - Dealer
   - automatically hitting to beat player
   - need not actually have and deal from deck
   - infinite bankroll
